# Project Overview
Originally published in 2003, the **S**tochastic **T**ime-**I**nverted **L**agrangian **T**ransport (STILT) model focuses on understanding the surface flux(es) and atmospheric transport that influences surface-based observations of the atmosphere ([Lin et al., 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JD003161); [Fasoli et al., 2018](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/11/2813/2018/)). This framework was built on the **Hy**brid **S**ingle-**P**article **L**agrangian **I**ntegrated **T**rajectory (HYSPLIT) model provided by the Air Resources Laboratory (ARL), a division of the **N**ational **O**ceanic and **A**tmospheric **A**dministration (NOAA) ([Stein et al., 2015](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/96/12/bams-d-14-00110.1.xml)). HYSPLIT is widely used to model the transport of wildfire smoke plumes, wind-blown dust, and radionuclides, with capabilties of forward-in-time and backward-in-time transport modes. On the other hand, STILT predominately makes use of the backwards-in-time approach to understand the upwind sources of measured gas concentrations in the atmosphere.

Recent work has expanded the STILT model to also be compatible with satellite observations of the atmosphere.
